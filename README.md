                                          I. Assignment 1.1 Create an XML
I created an XML file that stores data for a library. The library has two catalogues (technical books, and for cookery books). Each catalogue contains 2 books. Books have an ISBN, title and author. To open the file use Notepad++.

                                          II. Assignment 03
Write a program that retrieves the dataset for the "exchequer account(historical series)" from the CSO, and stores it into a file called "cso.json". Upload this program to the same repository you used from the XML assignment and save this assignment as "assignmnet03-cs0.py".

                                          III. Assignment 04
Write a program in python that will read a file from a repository. The program should then replace all the instances of the text "Andrew" with your name. The program should then commit those changes and push the file back to the repository. Save the program as assignment04-github.py to the same repository you uploaded the xml to.
