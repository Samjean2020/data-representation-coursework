I. Assignment 1.1 Create an XML. Exercise 1.1. I created an XML file that stores data for a library. The library has two catalogues (technical books, and for cookery books).
Each catalogue contains 2 books. Books have an ISBN, title and author. To open the file use Notepad++.
II. Assignment 03. Monday, 16 October 2023: Write a program that retrieves the dataset for the "exchequer account(historical series)" from the CSO, and stores it into a file called "cso.json". Upload this program to the same repository you used from the XML assignment and save this assignment as "assignmnet03-cs0.py".
